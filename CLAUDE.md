# CLAUDE.md — Engineering Standards for kairix

Shared knowledge layer for human-agent teams. See [README.md](README.md) for product context.

## How to commit

Use `bash scripts/safe-commit.sh "message"` for every commit. It runs lint, format, mypy, tests, and security checks. Loop on failures until green. See [CONSTRAINTS.md](CONSTRAINTS.md) for what blocks a commit.

## How to test

Test with fakes from `tests/fakes.py`, not monkey-patches. Construct pipelines with fake implementations. See `tests/contracts/test_protocols.py` for protocol compliance patterns.

## Architecture

Protocols define boundaries. Pipelines compose protocols. Factories build production pipelines. Repositories own data access. Strategies replace if/elif branches. See [docs/architecture/ENGINEERING.md](docs/architecture/ENGINEERING.md) for detail.

Key files:
- `kairix/core/protocols.py` — all domain boundary protocols
- `kairix/core/factory.py` — production pipeline construction
- `kairix/core/search/pipeline.py` — SearchPipeline orchestrator
- `tests/fakes.py` — fake implementations for testing

## How to delegate work

Ralph pattern: fine-grained file-scoped work, parallel agents with embedded backpressure loops, `safe-commit.sh` in each loop. 10-15 loops/hour target. See [engineering hub](https://github.com/three-cubes/engineering-hub/tree/main/ralph).

**Default: subagents commit straight to develop, dispatched sequentially.** Do not use `isolation="worktree"` by default — parallel agents on the main checkout race on git operations (`checkout`, `reset`, `ruff format` act on the whole tree), and killed worktree-locked agents leave orphan branches that need force cleanup.

**Worktrees are acceptable only for user-authorized parallel batches.** When the user explicitly asks for parallelism, each agent gets its own worktree, commits to its own branch, returns its path + branch on completion; merge each branch back to develop as it lands.

Either way, every agent runs `safe-commit.sh` in its loop and only pushes when green.

## Naming

- Code: `snake_case` functions, `PascalCase` classes, `UPPER_SNAKE_CASE` constants
- User-facing: grade 8 reading level, "knowledge store" not "vault"
- Test agents: generic names (agent-alpha, agent-beta)

## CI

Stages: pre-commit → contracts → unit+bdd+contract+mypy → integration → security → Docker → SonarCloud + Codecov. All must pass before merge.
